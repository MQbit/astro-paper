# AutoGPT: build & use AI agents

**AutoGPT** is the vision of the power of AI accessible to everyone, to use and to build on. Our mission is to provide the tools, so that you can focus on what matters:

- üèóÔ∏è **Building** - Lay the foundation for something amazing.
- üß™ **Testing** - Fine-tune your agent to perfection.
- ü§ù **Delegating** - Let AI work for you, and have your ideas come to life.

Be part of the revolution! **AutoGPT** is here to stay, at the forefront of AI innovation.

## What is AutoGPT?

AutoGPT is at the forefront of AI, utilizing large language models to push the boundaries of what's possible. It empowers individuals and businesses alike with cutting-edge resources. For developers, it simplifies complexity and focuses on intelligent system design.

AutoGPT also redefines AI performance assessment with automated, objective metrics, fostering innovation. For end-users, it offers an intuitive interface for complex tasks without compromising depth or functionality. This aligns with our goal of achieving safe AGI.

## AutoGPT Features

- Internet Access: AutoGPT can search the web and gather information to complete tasks.
- Memory Management: AutoGPT has long-term and short-term memory capabilities to maintain context.
- Text Generation: Powered by GPT-4, AutoGPT can generate natural language text.
- File Storage: AutoGPT can store, summarize, and process files.
- Code Execution: AutoGPT can write and run code to accomplish programming tasks.
- Plugins: The open-source nature of AutoGPT allows developers to extend its capabilities through plugins.

## How Does The AutoGPT Work?

AutoGPTs typically utilize a language model such as GPT-4 at its core AI engine. When given command for a task, it can create a plan to accomplish the goal, prompting GPT-4 to help at each step. It leverages memory, internet access, and text generation to iteratively make progress until the task is complete.

AutoGPT continuously evaluates the quality of its work. If an output does not meet a certain threshold, it will retry and reformulate its approach. This autonomous loop allows it to improve with experience.
